# HBB_MiniProject
A comparative analysis of the hemoglobin beta gene across eight species:
Homo sapiens (Human)
Pan troglodytes (Chimpanzee)
Bos taurus (Cattle)
Mus musculus (Mouse)
Rattus norvegicus (Rat)
Gallus gallus (Chicken)
Xenopus laevis (Frog)
Danio rerio (Zebrafish)
This analysis was conducted as part of Module 2 of the BioinformHer Training Program to explore molecular evolution using bioinformatics tools and techniques.
# Project objective
By retrieving nucleotide and protein sequences, performing sequence alignments, and constructing a phylogenetic tree, the study aims to analyze and compare Hemoglobin Beta (HBB) protein sequences across vertebrates in order to uncover evolutionary relationships and functional conservation through sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis.
# Bioinformatics Tools & Techniques Used
NCBI Gene & Nucleotide Database - Sequence retrieval
BLAST (NCBI & EMBOSS needle) - Pairwise alignment
Clustal Omega - Multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
Skylign - Sequence logo generation 
MEGAX Software - Phylogenetic tree construction
# Results
High conservation of HBB observed among mammals.
Moderate divergence in amphibians and fish reflects evolutionary distance.
Key regions of the protein remain conserved, highlighting functional importance.
# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of bioinformatics in studying molecular evolution. The Hemoglobin Beta gene, due to its vital role, shows strong evolutionary conservation, especially among mammals. Tools like BLAST, MSA, and phylogenetic reconstruction offer valuable insights into protein function and evolutionary biology.
